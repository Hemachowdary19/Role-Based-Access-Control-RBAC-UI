# Role-Based-Access-Control-RBAC-UI

The Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) UI is a comprehensive admin dashboard designed to streamline the management of users, roles, and permissions in an application. 

This project aims to provide a secure, intuitive interface for administrators, enabling efficient user account handling, role definitions, permission assignments, and access control to ensure system security.

**Features Overview**

**1. User Management**

->Admins can view, add, edit, and delete users.

->Assign specific roles to users and manage their activity status (Active/Inactive).

**2. Role Management**

->Define, modify, and delete roles.

->Assign permissions like "Read," "Write," and "Delete" to each role for granular control.

**3. Permission Management**

->Dynamically assign or modify permissions for each role, allowing flexibility in user access levels.

**4. Responsive Design**

->A fully responsive UI ensures seamless usability across desktop and mobile devices.

**5. Dark Mode**

->Toggleable dark mode for enhanced user comfort and preference.

**My Contributions**

**UI/UX Design**

1.Dashboard Layout: Designed an intuitive layout with clear navigation via sidebars and modals.

2.Responsive Design: Ensured the dashboard was fully functional on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

3.User-Friendly Interface: Focused on simple workflows for user and role management with clear call-to-action buttons.

**Role and Permission Management**

1.Add/Edit Role Modal:

->Created a modal to define roles and assign permissions using checkboxes for actions like "Read," "Write," and "Delete."

->Enabled dynamic updates to roles and permissions, reflected instantly in the UI.

2.Granular Access Control: 

->Developed a system to allow administrators to modify permissions easily for each role.

**User Management Features**

**Implemented user-related functionalities:**

->Adding new users, editing details, and deleting accounts.

->Managing user roles and toggling activity status (Active/Inactive).

**Dark Mode Integration**

->Designed a dark mode toggle to switch between light and dark themes.

->Stored the user's theme preference in local storage for persistence across sessions.

**Dynamic Role-Based Permission System**

->Built a robust system for assigning permissions to roles.

->Supported real-time updates to permissions for new and existing roles.

**Simulating CRUD Operations**

->Simulated server-side operations like Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) using JavaScript arrays.

->Enabled real-time interaction and seamless data updates within the UI.

**Enhanced Responsiveness and Interactivity**

->Developed a collapsible, mobile-responsive sidebar to optimize navigation on smaller screens.

->Ensured all modals (Add/Edit User and Role) were mobile-friendly and visually appealing.

**User-Centric Design Approach**

**Prioritized user experience (UX) by focusing on:**

->Intuitive navigation and clear instructions for all actions.

->Real-time feedback, including form validations and success/error messages.

->Streamlined workflows for quick and effective administration.

**Technologies Used**

1.HTML: Markup for structuring the dashboard interface.

2.CSS: Custom styles for responsive and visually appealing design.

3.JavaScript: Dynamic interactivity, CRUD simulation, and functionality.

**Key Takeaways**

This project demonstrates a practical implementation of an RBAC system with a focus on:

->Security and granularity in access control.

->Responsive, mobile-friendly design.

->User-centered workflows and intuitive interfaces.

It serves as a foundational example for building role-based access systems in real-world applications.
